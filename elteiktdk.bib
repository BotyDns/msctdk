abstract = {Abstract Principal component analysis (PCA) is a multivariate technique that analyzes a data table in which observations are described by several inter-correlated quantitative dependent variables. Its goal is to extract the important information from the table, to represent it as a set of new orthogonal variables called principal components, and to display the pattern of similarity of the observations and of the variables as points in maps. The quality of the PCA model can be evaluated using cross-validation techniques such as the bootstrap and the jackknife. PCA can be generalized as correspondence analysis (CA) in order to handle qualitative variables and as multiple factor analysis (MFA) in order to handle heterogeneous sets of variables. Mathematically, PCA depends upon the eigen-decomposition of positive semi-definite matrices and upon the singular value decomposition (SVD) of rectangular matrices.

abstract={Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

abstract = {Mismanaged plastic waste (MPW) entering the riverine environment is concerning, given that most plastic pollution never reaches the oceans, and it has a severe negative impact on terrestrial ecosystems. However, significant knowledge gaps on the storage and remobilization of MPW within different rivers over varying timescales remain. Here we analyze the exposure of river systems to MPW to better understand the sedimentary processes that control the legacy of plastic waste. Using a conservative approach, we estimate 0.8 million tonnes of MPW enter rivers annually in 2015, affecting an estimated 84 % of rivers by surface area, globally. By 2060, the amount of MPW input to rivers is expected to increase nearly 3-fold, however improved plastic waste strategies through better governance can decrease plastic pollution by up to 72 %. Currently, most plastic input occurs along anthropogenically modified rivers (49 %) yet these represent only 23 % of rivers by surface area. Another 17 % of MPW occur in free-flowing actively migrating meandering rivers that likely retain most plastic waste within sedimentary deposits, increasing retention times and likelihood of biochemical weathering. Active braided rivers receive less MPW (14 %), but higher water discharge will also increase fragmentation to form microplastics. Only 20 % of plastic pollution is found in non-migrating and free-flowing rivers; these have the highest probability of plastics remaining within the water column and being transferred downstream. This study demonstrates the spatial variability in MPW affecting different global river systems with different retention, fragmentation, and biochemical weathering rates of plastics. Targeted mitigation strategies and environmental risk assessments are needed at both international and national levels that consider river system dynamics.}

pages={514-522},
abstract={Plastic pollution in the world's rivers and ocean is increasingly threatening ecosystem health and human livelihood. In contrast to what is commonly assumed, most mismanaged plastic waste that enters the environment is not exported into the ocean. Rivers are therefore not only conduits but also reservoirs of plastic pollution. Plastic mobilization, transport and retention dynamics are influenced by hydrological processes and river catchment features (for example, land use, vegetation and river morphology). Increased river discharge has been associated with elevated plastic transport rates, although the exact relation between the two can vary over time and space. However, the precise role of an extreme discharge event on plastic transport is still unknown. Here we show that fluvial floods drive macroplastic (>2.5{\thinspace}cm) transport (items{\thinspace}h−1) and accumulation (items{\thinspace}m−2) in river systems. We collected unique observational evidence during the July 2021 flood along the whole Dutch part of the Meuse. Plastic transport multiplied by a factor of over 100 compared with non-flood conditions (3.3{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}104 versus 2.3{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}102 items{\thinspace}h−1). Over one-third of the modelled annual plastic item transport was estimated to occur within 6{\thinspace}days of extreme discharge. Between Maastricht and Ravenstein (291{\thinspace}km and 131{\thinspace}km from the river mouth), plastic transport during the flood period decreased by 90{\%}, suggesting that the dispersal of plastic mobilized during the flood is limited due to the entrapment on riverbanks, in vegetation and on the floodplains. Plastic transport and accumulation on the riverbanks decreased significantly along the river, corroborating the river's function as a plastic reservoir. Using new observational evidence, we demonstrate the crucial role of floods as drivers of plastic transport and accumulation in river systems. Floods amplify the mobilization of plastics, but the effects are local, and the river-scale dispersal is limited. We anticipate that our findings will serve as a starting point for improving global estimates of river plastic transport, retention and export into the sea. Moreover, our results provide essential insights for future large-scale and long-term quantitative assessments of river plastic pollution. Reliable observations and a fundamental understanding of plastic transport are key to designing effective prevention and reduction strategies.},

abstract={Plastic waste monitoring technology based on Earth observation satellites is one approach that is currently under development in various studies. The complexity of land cover and the high human activity around rivers necessitate the development of studies that can improve the accuracy of monitoring plastic waste in river areas. This study aims to identify illegal dumping in a river area using the adjusted plastic index (API) and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery data. Rancamanyar River has been selected as the research area; it is one of the tributaries of Citarum Indonesia and is an open lotic-simple form, oxbow lake type river. Our study is the first attempt to construct an API and random forest machine learning using Sentinel-2 to identify the illegal dumping of plastic waste. The algorithm development integrated the plastic index algorithm with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized buildup indices. For the validation process, the results of plastic waste image classification based on Pleiades satellite imagery and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry was used. The validation results show that the API succeeded in improving the accuracy of identifying plastic waste, which gave a better correlation in the r-value and p-value by{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}0.287014 and{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}3.76{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}10−26 with Pleiades, and{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}0.143131 and{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}3.17{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}10−10 with UAV.},

We operationally tested the use of multispectral images (5 bands) to classify litter type and material on a beach-dune system. For litter categorization by their multispectral characteristics, the Spectral Angle Mapping (SAM) technique was adopted. The SAM-based categorization of litter agreed with the visual classification, thus multispectral images can be used to fasten and/or making more robust the manual RGB image screening. Fully automated detection returned an F-score of 0.64, and a reasonable categorization of litter. Overall, the image-based litter density maps were in line with the manual detection. Assessments were promising given the complexity of the study area, where different dunes plants and partially-buried items challenged the UAS-based litter detection. The method can be easily implemented for both floating and beached litter, to advance litter survey in the environment.}

Waste was evaluated by means of the indexes relating waste production to crop type and plastic application as defined by the land use map realized by classifying the Landsat 8 image. The image classification was carried out using Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and the accuracy assessment showed that the overall accuracy was 94.54% and the kappa coefficient equal to 0.934.

The goal of our research was to define a completely automatized methodology for the segmentation of vegetation (specifically trees) in urban environment, followed by the qualification and quantification of change detection. Our proposed algorithm provides a robust approach designed to scale dynamically to large areas, in contrast to existing methods that require manual or semi-supervised human interaction and can only be applied on relatively small areas. The algorithm was tested on parts of the Dutch and the Estonian altimetry archives, point cloud datasets that provide several terabytes of data. It was proved to be an effective method for the qualified and quantified change detection of trees, including height and volume changes.}

ABSTRACT = {Plastic litter floating in the ocean is a significant problem on a global scale. This study examines whether Sentinel-2 satellite images can be used to identify plastic litter on the sea surface for monitoring, collection and disposal. A pilot study was conducted to determine if plastic targets on the sea surface can be detected using remote sensing techniques with Sentinel-2 data. A target made up of plastic water bottles with a surface measuring 3 m × 10 m was created, which was subsequently placed in the sea near the Old Port in Limassol, Cyprus. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was used to acquire multispectral aerial images of the area of interest during the same time as the Sentinel-2 satellite overpass. Spectral signatures of the water and the plastic litter after it was placed in the water were taken with an SVC HR1024 spectroradiometer. The study found that the plastic litter target was easiest to detect in the NIR wavelengths. Seven established indices for satellite image processing were examined to determine whether they can identify plastic litter in the water. Further, the authors examined two new indices, the Plastics Index (PI) and the Reversed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (RNDVI) to be used in the processing of the satellite image. The newly developed Plastic Index (PI) was able to identify plastic objects floating on the water surface and was the most effective index in identifying the plastic litter target in the sea.},
