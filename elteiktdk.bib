abstract = {Abstract Principal component analysis (PCA) is a multivariate technique that analyzes a data table in which observations are described by several inter-correlated quantitative dependent variables. Its goal is to extract the important information from the table, to represent it as a set of new orthogonal variables called principal components, and to display the pattern of similarity of the observations and of the variables as points in maps. The quality of the PCA model can be evaluated using cross-validation techniques such as the bootstrap and the jackknife. PCA can be generalized as correspondence analysis (CA) in order to handle qualitative variables and as multiple factor analysis (MFA) in order to handle heterogeneous sets of variables. Mathematically, PCA depends upon the eigen-decomposition of positive semi-definite matrices and upon the singular value decomposition (SVD) of rectangular matrices.

abstract={Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

abstract = {Mismanaged plastic waste (MPW) entering the riverine environment is concerning, given that most plastic pollution never reaches the oceans, and it has a severe negative impact on terrestrial ecosystems. However, significant knowledge gaps on the storage and remobilization of MPW within different rivers over varying timescales remain. Here we analyze the exposure of river systems to MPW to better understand the sedimentary processes that control the legacy of plastic waste. Using a conservative approach, we estimate 0.8 million tonnes of MPW enter rivers annually in 2015, affecting an estimated 84 % of rivers by surface area, globally. By 2060, the amount of MPW input to rivers is expected to increase nearly 3-fold, however improved plastic waste strategies through better governance can decrease plastic pollution by up to 72 %. Currently, most plastic input occurs along anthropogenically modified rivers (49 %) yet these represent only 23 % of rivers by surface area. Another 17 % of MPW occur in free-flowing actively migrating meandering rivers that likely retain most plastic waste within sedimentary deposits, increasing retention times and likelihood of biochemical weathering. Active braided rivers receive less MPW (14 %), but higher water discharge will also increase fragmentation to form microplastics. Only 20 % of plastic pollution is found in non-migrating and free-flowing rivers; these have the highest probability of plastics remaining within the water column and being transferred downstream. This study demonstrates the spatial variability in MPW affecting different global river systems with different retention, fragmentation, and biochemical weathering rates of plastics. Targeted mitigation strategies and environmental risk assessments are needed at both international and national levels that consider river system dynamics.}

pages={514-522},
abstract={Plastic pollution in the world's rivers and ocean is increasingly threatening ecosystem health and human livelihood. In contrast to what is commonly assumed, most mismanaged plastic waste that enters the environment is not exported into the ocean. Rivers are therefore not only conduits but also reservoirs of plastic pollution. Plastic mobilization, transport and retention dynamics are influenced by hydrological processes and river catchment features (for example, land use, vegetation and river morphology). Increased river discharge has been associated with elevated plastic transport rates, although the exact relation between the two can vary over time and space. However, the precise role of an extreme discharge event on plastic transport is still unknown. Here we show that fluvial floods drive macroplastic (>2.5{\thinspace}cm) transport (items{\thinspace}h−1) and accumulation (items{\thinspace}m−2) in river systems. We collected unique observational evidence during the July 2021 flood along the whole Dutch part of the Meuse. Plastic transport multiplied by a factor of over 100 compared with non-flood conditions (3.3{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}104 versus 2.3{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}102 items{\thinspace}h−1). Over one-third of the modelled annual plastic item transport was estimated to occur within 6{\thinspace}days of extreme discharge. Between Maastricht and Ravenstein (291{\thinspace}km and 131{\thinspace}km from the river mouth), plastic transport during the flood period decreased by 90{\%}, suggesting that the dispersal of plastic mobilized during the flood is limited due to the entrapment on riverbanks, in vegetation and on the floodplains. Plastic transport and accumulation on the riverbanks decreased significantly along the river, corroborating the river's function as a plastic reservoir. Using new observational evidence, we demonstrate the crucial role of floods as drivers of plastic transport and accumulation in river systems. Floods amplify the mobilization of plastics, but the effects are local, and the river-scale dispersal is limited. We anticipate that our findings will serve as a starting point for improving global estimates of river plastic transport, retention and export into the sea. Moreover, our results provide essential insights for future large-scale and long-term quantitative assessments of river plastic pollution. Reliable observations and a fundamental understanding of plastic transport are key to designing effective prevention and reduction strategies.},

abstract={Plastic waste monitoring technology based on Earth observation satellites is one approach that is currently under development in various studies. The complexity of land cover and the high human activity around rivers necessitate the development of studies that can improve the accuracy of monitoring plastic waste in river areas. This study aims to identify illegal dumping in a river area using the adjusted plastic index (API) and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery data. Rancamanyar River has been selected as the research area; it is one of the tributaries of Citarum Indonesia and is an open lotic-simple form, oxbow lake type river. Our study is the first attempt to construct an API and random forest machine learning using Sentinel-2 to identify the illegal dumping of plastic waste. The algorithm development integrated the plastic index algorithm with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized buildup indices. For the validation process, the results of plastic waste image classification based on Pleiades satellite imagery and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry was used. The validation results show that the API succeeded in improving the accuracy of identifying plastic waste, which gave a better correlation in the r-value and p-value by{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}0.287014 and{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}3.76{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}10−26 with Pleiades, and{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}0.143131 and{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}3.17{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}10−10 with UAV.},

We operationally tested the use of multispectral images (5 bands) to classify litter type and material on a beach-dune system. For litter categorization by their multispectral characteristics, the Spectral Angle Mapping (SAM) technique was adopted. The SAM-based categorization of litter agreed with the visual classification, thus multispectral images can be used to fasten and/or making more robust the manual RGB image screening. Fully automated detection returned an F-score of 0.64, and a reasonable categorization of litter. Overall, the image-based litter density maps were in line with the manual detection. Assessments were promising given the complexity of the study area, where different dunes plants and partially-buried items challenged the UAS-based litter detection. The method can be easily implemented for both floating and beached litter, to advance litter survey in the environment.}

Waste was evaluated by means of the indexes relating waste production to crop type and plastic application as defined by the land use map realized by classifying the Landsat 8 image. The image classification was carried out using Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and the accuracy assessment showed that the overall accuracy was 94.54% and the kappa coefficient equal to 0.934.

Airborne LiDAR is especially useful in the analysis and classification of land objects. We are able to determine if they are natural or artificial objects and what changes occurred to them throughout time by examining multi-temporal data. The goal of our research was to define a completely automatized methodology for the segmentation of vegetation (specifically trees) in urban environment, followed by the qualification and quantification of change detection. Our proposed algorithm provides a robust approach designed to scale dynamically to large areas, in contrast to existing methods that require manual or semi-supervised human interaction and can only be applied on relatively small areas. The algorithm was tested on parts of the Dutch and the Estonian altimetry archives, point cloud datasets that provide several terabytes of data. It was proved to be an effective method for the qualified and quantified change detection of trees, including height and volume changes.}

ABSTRACT = {Plastic litter floating in the ocean is a significant problem on a global scale. This study examines whether Sentinel-2 satellite images can be used to identify plastic litter on the sea surface for monitoring, collection and disposal. A pilot study was conducted to determine if plastic targets on the sea surface can be detected using remote sensing techniques with Sentinel-2 data. A target made up of plastic water bottles with a surface measuring 3 m × 10 m was created, which was subsequently placed in the sea near the Old Port in Limassol, Cyprus. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was used to acquire multispectral aerial images of the area of interest during the same time as the Sentinel-2 satellite overpass. Spectral signatures of the water and the plastic litter after it was placed in the water were taken with an SVC HR1024 spectroradiometer. The study found that the plastic litter target was easiest to detect in the NIR wavelengths. Seven established indices for satellite image processing were examined to determine whether they can identify plastic litter in the water. Further, the authors examined two new indices, the Plastics Index (PI) and the Reversed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (RNDVI) to be used in the processing of the satellite image. The newly developed Plastic Index (PI) was able to identify plastic objects floating on the water surface and was the most effective index in identifying the plastic litter target in the sea.},

abstract = {Decision trees trace their origins to the era of the early development of written records. This history illustrates a major strength of trees: exceptionally interpretable results which have an intuitive tree-like display which, in turn, enhances understanding and the dissemination of results. The computational origins of decision trees—sometimes called classification trees or regression trees—are models of biological and cognitive processes. This common heritage drives complementary developments of both statistical decision trees and trees designed for machine learning. The unfolding and progressive elucidation of the various features of trees throughout their early history in the late 20th century is discussed along with the important associated reference points and responsible authors. Statistical approaches, such as a hypothesis testing and various resampling approaches, have coevolved along with machine learning implementations. This had resulted in exceptionally adaptable decision tree tools, appropriate for various statistical and machine learning tasks, across various levels of measurement, with varying levels of data quality. Trees are robust in the presence of missing data and offer multiple ways of incorporating missing data in the resulting models. Although trees are powerful, they are also flexible and easy to use methods. This assures the production of high quality results that require few assumptions to deploy. The treatment ends with a discussion of the most current developments which continue to rely on the synergies and cross-fertilization between statistical and machine learning communities. Current developments with the emergence of multiple trees and the various resampling approaches that are employed are discussed.

abstract={With the advancement of global civilisation, monitoring and managing dumpsites have become essential parts of environmental governance in various countries. Dumpsite locations are difficult to obtain in a timely manner by local government agencies and environmental groups. The World Bank shows that governments need to spend massive labour and economic costs to collect illegal dumpsites to implement management. Here we show that applying novel deep convolutional networks to high-resolution satellite images can provide an effective, efficient, and low-cost method to detect dumpsites. In sampled areas of 28 cities around the world, our model detects nearly 1000 dumpsites that appeared around 2021. This approach reduces the investigation time by more than 96.8{\%} compared with the manual method. With this novel and powerful methodology, it is now capable of analysing the relationship between dumpsites and various social attributes on a global scale, temporally and spatially.},

ABSTRACT = {Illegal landfills are uncontrolled disposals of waste that cause severe environmental and health risk. Discovering them as early as possible is of prominent importance for preventing hazards, such as fire pollution and leakage. Before the digital era, the only means to detect illegal waste dumps was the on site inspection of potentially suspicious sites, a procedure extremely costly and impossible to scale to a vast territory. With the advent of Earth observation technology, scanning the territory via aerial images has become possible. However, manual image interpretation remains a complex and time-consuming task that requires expert skill. Photo interpretation can be partially automated by embedding the expert knowledge within a data driven classifier trained with samples provided by human annotators. In this paper, the detection of illegal landfills is formulated as a multi-scale scene classification problem. Scene elements positioning and spatial relations constitute hints of the presence of illegal waste dumps. A dataset of ≈3000 images (20 cm resolution per pixel) was created with the help of expert photo interpreters. A combination of ResNet50 and Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) elements accounting for different object scales achieves 88% precision with an 87% of recall in a test area. The results proved the feasibility of applying convolutional neural networks for scene classification in this scenario to optimize the process of waste dumps detection.},

ABSTRACT = {A significant amount of the produced solid waste reaching the oceans is made of plastics. The amount of plastic debris in the ocean and coastal areas is steadily increasing and is now a major global environmental issue. The monitoring of marine plastic litter, ground-based monitoring systems and/or field campaigns are time-consuming, expensive, require great organisational efforts, and provide very limited information in terms of the spatial and temporal dynamics of marine debris. Earth Observation (EO) by satellite can contribute significantly to marine plastic litter detection. In 2019, a new hyperspectral satellite, called PRISMA, was launched by the Italian Space Agency. The high spectral resolution of PRISMA may allow for better detection of floating plastic materials. At the same time, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have the potential to find hidden patterns and identify complex relations among data and are increasingly employed in EO. This paper presents the development of a new method of identifying floating plastic objects in coastal areas by exploiting pan-sharpened hyperspectral PRISMA data, based on the combination of unsupervised and supervised ML algorithms. The study consisted of a configuration phase, during which the algorithms were trained in a fully controlled test, and a validation phase, in which the pre-trained algorithms were applied to satellite data collected at different sites and in different periods of the year. Despite the limited input data, results suggest that the tested ML approach, applied to pan-sharpened PRISMA data, can effectively recognise floating objects and plastic targets. The study indicates that increasing input datasets can help achieve higher-quality results.},

title = {Machine learning for aquatic plastic litter detection, classification and quantification (APLASTIC-Q)},
journal = {Environmental Research Letters},
abstract = {Large quantities of mismanaged plastic waste are polluting and threatening the health of the blue planet. As such, vast amounts of this plastic waste found in the oceans originates from land. It finds its way to the open ocean through rivers, waterways and estuarine systems. Here we present a novel machine learning algorithm based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that is capable of detecting and quantifying floating and washed ashore plastic litter. The aquatic plastic litter detection, classification and quantification system (APLASTIC-Q) was developed and trained using very high geo-spatial resolution imagery (∼5 pixels cm−1 = 0.002 m pixel−1) captured from aerial surveys in Cambodia. APLASTIC-Q was made up of two machine learning components (i) plastic litter detector (PLD-CNN) and (ii) plastic litter quantifier (PLQ-CNN). PLD-CNN managed to categorize targets as water, sand, vegetation and plastic litter with an 83% accuracy. It also provided a qualitative count of litter as low or high based on a thresholding approach. PLQ-CNN further distinguished and enumerated the litter items in each of the classes defined as water bottles, Styrofoam, canisters, cartons, bowls, shoes, polystyrene packaging, cups, textile, carry bags small or large. The types and amounts of plastic litter provide benchmark information that is urgently needed for decision-making by policymakers, citizens and other public and private stakeholders. Quasi-quantification was based on automated counts of items present in the imagery with caveats of underlying object in case of aggregated litter. Our scientific evidence-based machine learning algorithm has the prospects of complementing net trawl surveys, field campaigns and clean-up activities for improved quantification of plastic litter. APLASTIC-Q is a smart algorithm that is easy to adapt for fast and automated detection as well as quantification of floating or washed ashore plastic litter from aerial, high-altitude pseudo satellites and space missions.}

abstract = {The amount of marine litter, mainly composed by plastic materials, has become a global environmental issue in coastal environments. Traditional monitoring programs are based on in-situ visual census, which require human effort and are time-demanding. Therefore, it is crucial to implement innovative mapping strategies to improve the environmental monitoring of marine litter on the coast. This work presents a procedure for an automated Unmanned Aerial System (UAS)-based marine litter mapping on a beach-dune system. A multidisciplinary framework, which comprises photogrammetry, geomorphology, machine learning and hydrodynamic modelling, was developed to process a block of UAS images. The work shows how each of these scientific methodologies can be complementary to improve and making more efficient the mapping of marine litter items with UAS on coastal environment. The very high-resolution orthophoto produced from UAS images was automatically screened by random forest machine learning method, in order to characterize the marine litter load on beach and dune areas, distinctively. The marine litter objects were identified with a F-test score of 75% when compared to manual procedure. The location of major marine litter loads within the monitored area was found related to beach slope and water level dynamics on the beach profiles, suggesting that UAS flight deployment and post-processing for beach litter mapping can be optimized based on these environmental parameters. The described UAS-based marine litter detection framework is intended to support scientists, engineers and decision makers aiming at monitoring marine and coastal pollution, with the additional aim of optimizing and automating beach clean-up operations.}

abstract = {A global beach litter assessment is challenged by use of low-efficiency methodologies and incomparable protocols that impede data integration and acquisition at a national scale. The implementation of an objective, reproducible and efficient approach is therefore required. Here we show the application of a remote sensing based methodology using a test beach located on the Saudi Arabian Red Sea coastline. Litter was recorded via image acquisition from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, while an automatic processing of the high volume of imagery was developed through machine learning, employed for debris detection and classification in three categories. Application of the method resulted in an almost 40 times faster beach coverage when compared to a standard visual-census approach. While the machine learning tool faced some challenges in correctly detecting objects of interest, first classification results are promising and motivate efforts to further develop the technique and implement it at much larger scales.}

ABSTRACT = {As a result of tightened waste regulation across Europe, reports of waste crime have been on the rise. Significant stockpiles of tyres and plastic materials have been identified as a threat to both human and environmental health, leading to water and livestock contamination, providing substantial fuel for fires, and cultivating a variety of disease vectors. Traditional methods of identifying illegal stockpiles usually involve laborious field surveys, which are unsuitable for national scale management. Remotely-sensed investigations to tackle waste have been less explored due to the spectrally variable and complex nature of tyres and plastics, as well as their similarity to other land covers such as water and shadow. Therefore, the overall objective of this study was to develop an accurate classification method for both tyre and plastic waste to provide a viable platform for repeatable, cost-effective, and large-scale monitoring. An augmented land cover classification is presented that combines Copernicus Sentinel-2 optical imagery with thematic indices and Copernicus Sentinel-1 microwave data, and two random forests land cover classification algorithms were trained for the detection of tyres and plastics across Scotland. Testing of the method identified 211 confirmed tyre and plastic stockpiles, with overall classification accuracies calculated above 90%.},

abstract = {An important success and use of Deep Learning in recent years has been in the field of image processing. Research on Deep Learning has shown that these architectures particularly convolution neuron network (CNN) can learn solutions with human-level capability for certain visual tasks. These techniques have been used in particular in remote sensing image analysis tasks, including object detection on images, image fusion, image recording, scene classification, segmentation, object-based image analysis, land use and land cover classification (LULC). In this paper we present an automatic solution for the detection of clandestine waste dumps using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images in the Saint Louis area of Senegal, West Africa. This is a challenging task given the very high spatial resolution of UAV images (on the order of a few centimeters) and the extremely high level of detail, which require suitable automatic analysis methods. Our proposed method begins by 1) segmenting image into four (4) regions, which can be used as an input image 2) Reduce size of input images into 300x300x3 for the CNN entries 3) Labelling the image by determining region of interest. Next Single shot detector SSD is used to mine highly descriptive features from these datasets. The results show that the model recognizes well the areas concerned but presents difficulties on some areas lacking clear ground truths.}
